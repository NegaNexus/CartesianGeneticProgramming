* Cartesian Genetic Programming
  This is a C++ implementation of the Cartesian Genetic Programming model. It
uses the Evolution Strategies algorithm ES(1+4).

** Usage
   Run ~make~ followed by ~./cgp~ and your input to stdout, such as ~./cgp <
   tests/adder4.in~

   Also, see [[assignment-description.pdf]] for details on output format.

** Credits
   Inspiration came from /Introduction to Evolutionary Computation, 2nd Edition/
   by A. E. Eiben and J. E. Smith, /Essentials of Metaheuristics, 2nd Edition/
   by Sean Luke, /Cartesian Genetic Programming/ by Julian Miller, and the
   slides by Julian Miller in [[slides.pdf]].
   
   The [[rand.h]] header file and associated [[randmt.cup]] was provided by Robert Heckendorn.
